TecHacks project
Hello!


This is a prescription managing app created as an entry to the 2020 TecHacks Competition. Being passionate about creating mobile solutions for health issues, our team created this app to help users view their prescriptions in a cleaner format and store their prescriptions for future reference though the integration of the Mobile Vision API from ML Kit.
